There is a lot of depth to this topic (just as for *supervised* and *unsupervised* learning), and we can of course not cover it in one single week. For those that are interested we can recomend the book \"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction\" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.\n",

A common approach, which we have followed in this notebook, consists in alternating a step of *policy evaluation* and a step of *policy improvement*. In the example above, we have started with a random policy and we have computed the associated state-value matrix (policy evaluation); then, we have defined a greedy policy using the state-value matrix (policy improvement). This generic learning approach is called **Generalized Policy Iteration**. On more complex problem, several iterations of evaluation-improvement may be required to approximate an optimal policy."

    "In this notebook we studied the basics of **reinforcement learning** through the analysis on a simple *gridworld* environment of two core RL problems: **policy evaluation** and **policy improvement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first considered the problem of policy evaluation, that is, the problem of assessing how good a policy is. For **deterministic policies** we solved the problem simply by computing the *total discounted return* of a policy. After realizing the limitation of deterministic policies, we turned to **stochastic policies**, and we computed their *return in expectation* relying on *Monte Carlo methods*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we considered the problem of policy improvement, that is, the problem of learning optimal policies. For this task, we realized that a global value for a policy is not handy when improving a policy, and, instead local values would be more useful. We then computed **state values** and **action values** to assess a policy step by step, and used this values to take improved actions. This iterative approach, based on evaluating a policy and improving the policy, is an instance of the more generic method called **Generalized Policy Iteration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final optional part, we considered a more advanced RL algorithm, **Q-learning**. Q-learning allowed us to learn an optimal policy while interacting with an environment; this algorithm had two important features: (i) it learns in a continuous way, step-by-step, and not on complete episodes; (ii) it learns an optimal policy while behaving according to a different, more exploration-prone, policy."
